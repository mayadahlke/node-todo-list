# To-Do List
## By: Maya Dahlke
This is a to-do list application built using **Node.js** and **Embedded JavaScript (EJS) templating**. I created it during my free time to enhance and refine my Node.js development skills.  

### What?
Users can add tasks by entering a task and clicking 'Add Task'. Once tasks are completed, they can check them off and click 'Remove Completed Tasks' to delete them from the list. The tasks are saved to a file (`todo.txt`) on the server, so when the server restarts, the tasks persist and will be displayed on the screen.

### How?
To see the project, you can...
1. Clone this repository.
2. In terminal start the server by running `node --watch server.js`.
3. Go to `http://localhost:3000`.
4. Start using! :)
